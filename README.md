Hi,

this repository contains a python code on txt file that tried to build up a linear regression model on some csv data downloaded from Kaggle about the features of some Magic: The Gathering cadrs for certain expansion: the model tried to predict how the general rarity of a mtg card change as its converted mana cost changes.
